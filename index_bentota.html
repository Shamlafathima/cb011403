                    The conservation of the island's wildlife is of utmost importance because Sri Lanka is one of the world's major biodiversity hotspots. The issue is addressed by funding the survival of Sri Lanka's turtles at the several turtle hatcheries that dot the western coastline. One of them is bentota hatchery.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another notable attraction is the Turtle Hatchery Project at Bentota Beach. This undeveloped beach has been home to up to five endangered kinds of turtles for a very long time. Before being released, the turtles are given the opportunity to hatch and grow in a protected environment. For those who like nature, a trip to the turtle hatchery is a must.

                 <h3>Importance</h3>
                <p>When left on their own, turtle eggs are vulnerable to predators and helpless against them. Additionally, there is a chance that local fishermen will find the eggs and sell them to poachers, who would then sell them on the black market. In order to counter this, the hatcheries pay the fishermen more for their eggs, incentivizing them to continue bringing in the vulnerable eggs to a secure place.</p>

                <h3>Conservation Effort and What you can experience</h3>
                <p>When the eggs arrive at the hatchery, they are carefully buried in sand until they break free of their shells, at which point they are transported and put into tanks where they will spend the first few days of their life. This increases their chances of surviving by giving them a chance to get stronger before being returned to the perils of the water. In this way, several turtle species are preserved.</p>
        
                <p>
                    The newborn turtles are released on the beach at dusk, and you can watch them make their way back to the ocean. Visitors are urged to use caution while young turtles are released back into the water. Loud sounds, bright lights, and flash photography are prohibited because they could cause newborn turtles to mistake them for the moon over the water, which would prevent them from finding their way back home.

            <center><h4>The hatchery operates in the manner  below</h3></center>
            <ol>
                <li>Beach Conservation</li>
                <p>Although protecting turtle nesting areas is undoubtedly a difficult endeavor, it is essential for their effective reproduction. You can assist in these efforts by helping to maintain the beach clean and plant shelter plants, for example.</p>
                <li>Hatchery</li>
                <p>Collecting eggs from nests on the shore and reburying them within the hatchery, where they may safely hatch, makes up a significant portion of the hatchery's job. These hatchlings are later returned to their natural habitat.</p>
                <li>Night Patrol</li>
                <p>
                    Who claimed that the beach wasn't attractive at night? Patrolling the beach at night is one of the hatcheries' programs, which not only serves to stop poachers but also allows visitors to see lovely female turtles approaching their nests. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that shouldn't be passed up.
                </p>
                <li>Education and awareness</li>
                <p>The bentota Turtle Hatchery plays a significant role in raising awareness of the value of protecting these endangered species among locals and visitors. They accomplish this through neighborhood events and awareness initiatives, which allow for the collection of a lot of data.</p>
