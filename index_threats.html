                Sea turtles are built to last. Equipped with unique body Armor to protect them from their natural enemies, they have swum the seas since dinosaurs roamed the land. Sea turtles’ journey between land and sea and swim thousands of ocean miles during their long lifetimes. They wait decades until they can reproduce, returning to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. Females can lay hundreds of eggs in one nesting season, yet few will yield hatchlings that survive their first year of life. Beyond these significant natural challenges and rapidly increasing human populations have resulted in new and acute pressures, making sea turtle survival ever more difficult.

            <center><h4>MAJOR THREATS FACING BY TURTLES</h4></center>
        </div>
        <div class="sub_part1">
            <h5>Bycatch</h5>
            <p>
                Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of sea turtles are accidentally caught in shrimp trawl nets, on longline hooks and in fishing gill nets every year. They become fisheries' bycatch—animals accidentally caught in nets intended for other species.Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe and therefore many drown once caught. Incidental capture by fishing gear is the greatest threat to most sea turtles, especially endangered loggerheads, greens, and leatherbacks. This threat is increasing as fishing activity expands.

        <div class="sub_part2">
            <h5>Overharvesting and illegal trade</h5>
            <p>
                Sea turtles continue to be harvested unsustainably both for human consumption and trade of their parts. Turtle meat and eggs are a source of food and income for many people around the world. Some also kill turtles for medicine and religious ceremonies. Tens of thousands of sea turtles are lost this way every year, devastating populations of already endangered greens and hawksbills.Killing of turtles for both domestic and international markets continues as well. International trade in all sea turtle species and their parts is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global agreement among governments to regulate or ban international trade in species under threat. Still, illegal trafficking persists.

        </div>
        <div class="sub_part3">
            <h5>Habitat Loss</h5>
            <p>
                Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around the world. For example, lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away from the sea, and vehicle traffic on beaches compacts the sand, making it impossible for female turtles to dig nests. Turtle feeding grounds such as coral reefs and seagrass beds are damaged and destroyed by activities onshore, including sedimentation from clearing of land and nutrient run-off from agriculture. Beach restoration projects for protecting seaside buildings have also been found to be harmful, through dredging and sand filling.

        <div class="sub_part4">
            <h5>Climate changes</h5>
            <h6>Severe Storms</h6>
            <p>
                More severe storms, such as hurricanes and tropical cyclones, could increase beach erosion rates, endangering sea turtle nesting habitat. Often  severe storms could increase the chance that sea turtle nests will flood, decreasing nesting success rates.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/turtle34.jpeg" alt="server Storms" width="400" height="200">
            <h6>Hotter Sands</h6>
            <p>
                The sex of sea turtle hatchlings is influenced by the temperature of the sand in which the eggs develop. Climate change can cause increased temperature. Higher temperatures cause the sand to heat up and lead to a higher proportion of female to male hatchlings. One study concluded that it is likely that southern populations of turtles in the U.S. will become ultra-biased towards female populations if temperatures increase by even 1 C.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/turtle35.jpeg" alt="server Storms" width="400" height="200">
            <h6>Sea Level Rise</h6>
            <p>
                As climate change melts ice and warms the oceans, sea levels rise. Sea level rise  for the end of the 21st century range from 0.18 to 0.59 meters. Even a small rise in sea level could result in a large loss of beach nesting habitats..

        </div>
        <div class="sub_part5">
            <h5>Pollution</h5>
            <p>
                Solid waste, chemicals and pollutants from human activities enter the ocean, causing injury, illness and even death to sea turtles. The pollution sources range from wastewater discharge released by cruise liners to fishing nets that are lost by fishermen to fertilizer runoff that comes down rivers from farms. This means that even people living in the middle of the European Union can have an impact on the health of the oceans and sea turtles.
    
                Thousands of  chemicals contaminate the marine environment, many of which accumulate in the tissues of sea turtles, affecting their locomotion, brain functioning and reproductive success. Sea turtles also consume plastics and marine debris which are harmful to their digestive systems. Scientists believe that there may be a link between exposure to agricultural pollutants and the spread and prevalence of fibropapillomatosis, a disease in sea turtles that causes tumors to grow on the eyes, intestinal tracts, lungs, mouth, heart and other organs.

            <h4>How to prevent turtles from threats and help conserve their populations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> <span>Habitat Protection:</span>  Protecting the natural habitats of turtles is crucial. This involves preserving nesting beaches, wetlands, and other ecosystems where turtles live. Support and advocate for the establishment of protected areas, such as marine reserves or national parks, to safeguard turtle habitats.</li>
                <li> <span>Reduce Pollution:</span>  Pollution in water bodies can be detrimental to turtles. Reduce pollution by properly disposing of waste, avoiding the use of harmful chemicals, and promoting sustainable practices in your community. Participate in local cleanup initiatives to keep beaches and waterways free from trash.
                </li>
                <li> <span>Responsible Fishing and Boating:</span>  Turtles can get entangled in fishing nets or accidentally ingest fishing hooks. Practice responsible fishing by using turtle-friendly gear, such as circle hooks, and releasing any unintentionally caught turtles carefully. When boating, be aware of turtle habitats and avoid striking them with boat propellers.</li>
                <li> <span>Minimize Plastic Use:</span>  Plastic pollution is a significant threat to turtles. Reduce your plastic consumption and encourage others to do the same. Opt for reusable alternatives, recycle properly, and participate in beach or river cleanups to remove plastic debris.
                </li>
                <li> <span>Educate and Raise Awareness:</span>  Spread awareness about the importance of turtle conservation. Educate others about the threats turtles face and the actions they can take to help. Share information through social media, organize workshops, or collaborate with local schools or organizations to promote turtle conservation.
                </li>
                <li> <span>Support Conservation Efforts:</span>  Contribute to organizations and initiatives that work towards turtle conservation. These groups may conduct research, habitat restoration, rescue and rehabilitation, or public education programs. Your support can aid their efforts in protecting turtle populations.
                </li>
                <li> <span>Report Nesting Sites and Illegal Activities:</span>  If you come across turtle nesting sites or witness illegal activities like poaching or trade of turtle products, report them to the appropriate authorities. Prompt reporting can help prevent further harm to turtles and enable necessary actions to be taken.
                </li>
            
            </ul>
            <p>Remember, even small actions can make a difference in protecting turtles. It is essential to work collectively to ensure the long-term survival of these remarkable creatures.</p>
