                    <p>Sea turtles, sometimes called marine turtles. They are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The five existing species of sea turtles are the green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, and olive Ridley Sea turtles. All of the five species listed above are present in US waters, and are listed as endangered and/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. <br><br>In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and tortoises. However, the streamlined body plan reduces friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly. <br><br>The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle, measuring 2–3 m (6–9 ft) in length, 1–1.5 m (3–5 ft) in width, and weighing up to 700 kg (1500 lb). Other sea turtle species are smaller, being mostly 60–120 cm (2–4 ft) long and proportionally narrower. <br><br> The skulls of sea turtles have cheek regions that are enclosed in bone. Although this condition appears to resemble that found in the earliest known fossil reptiles (anapsids), it is possible it is a more recently evolved trait in sea turtles, placing them outside the anapsids. </p>

                    All oceans, excluding the polar ones, are home to sea turtles. Only the northern Australian coast is home to the flatback sea turtle. Only the Gulf of Mexico and the East Coast of the United States contain Kemp's ridley sea turtles. <br><br>Typically, sea turtles can be found in the waters along continental shelves. Sea turtles spend the most of their time in the pelagic zone floating in seaweed mats throughout the first three to five years of life. Sargassum mats are very common places to find green sea turtles, who live there and find food, shelter, and water there. When a sea turtle reaches adulthood, it begins to saunter closer to the shore. During the nesting season, females will land on sandy beaches to lay their eggs. <br><br>To get to their breeding beaches, which are few in number, sea turtles must travel. Because they live in the ocean, they typically travel over great distances. Every sea turtle has a big body, which is advantageous for covering long distances. enormous body sizes also provide effective defense against the enormous oceanic predators, particularly the sharks.

            <h4>SEA TURTLES LIFE CYCLE</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>NESTING BEACHES: ADULT FEMALE</span> - Within a few weeks of mating during nesting season, females come ashore to lay eggs. Once they are over the high-tide line, they use their front flippers to forcefully dig a massive depression known as a "body pit," sending sand flying into the air. Then, depending on the species, the females use their rear flippers to dig a smaller hole at the far end of the body pit called a "egg chamber," where they lay anywhere from 50 to 200 soft-shelled eggs. They return to the sea after restocking and sandbagging their nests.</li>
                        <li><span>ADULT FEMALES RETURN TO FEEDING AREAS AFTER NESTING SEASON</span> - This migration could take several months, depending on the distance.After each nesting season, females must return to feeding locations, which are often nearshore (neritic) habitats, to restock their energy reserves for the upcoming reproductive season. Usually, this phase lasts longer than a year, and frequently even many years. Large juveniles and other adults—both males and females—feast in these locations as well.</li>
                        <li><span>HATCHLINGS TO OCEAN AND EARLY YEARS IN OPEN OCEAN HABITAT</span> - When fully grown, hatchlings pierce their eggshell and slowly, and usually in groups, dig their way to the surface. This procedure could require several days.In order to avoid being seen by numerous predators on the beach and in the water, hatchlings typically wait until nighttime before making their way to the ocean. After entering the sea, hatchlings go into a multi-day "swimming frenzy," during which they swim nearly nonstop to reach deeper water farther from the shore using only remaining egg yolk as sustenance. Strong ocean currents carry young turtles to open-ocean environments, where they reside in flotsam like Sargassum mats (brown algae) and eat a variety of animals. The duration of this oceanic cycle ranges from a few years to decades.</li>
                        <li><span>DEVELOPMENTAL MIGRATIONS TO NERITIC FEEDING AREAS</span> - The juvenile turtles leave the water after this time and travel into extremely productive neritic (near shore) feeding regions to continue growing, which can take a few years or several decades. While these grazing areas typically provide more food overall and in a wider variety than the open ocean, they also frequently have more predators. Young turtles escape being eaten by waiting to reach these locations until they have grown larger in size. Additionally, adult turtles use neritic eating places. Adult turtles stay in these locations until they have built up enough energy reserves to move to breeding habitats. Usually, this phase lasts longer than a year, and frequently even many years.</li>
                        <li><span>MIGRATION OF ADULTS TO NATAL BEACHES FOR MATING</span> - Adult males and females travel to mating sites after gathering enough resources to mate and, in the case of females, to build nests. There can be hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers between feeding and breeding locations. Most females choose to nest at the same beach, or group of beaches, where they first appeared as hatchlings, each nesting season. Natal homing is the term used to describe an adult turtle's travel back to the beach where it was born.</li>
                        <li><span>MATING IN COASTAL AREAS NEAR NESTING BEACHES</span> - Multiple paternity is prevalent in sea turtles, despite the fact that a female normally only has to mate with one male to get enough sperm to fertilize all of her eggs in a season. This is probably because male sea turtles often want to mate with as many females as they can During mating season, men are highly combative with both females and other males.</li>
                        <li><span>ADULT MALES RETURN TO FEEDING AREAS</span> - Male turtles exhibit natal homing much like females do, but they go farther and to more locations than do females. During a season, males will attempt to mate with as many females as they can. Males return to their eating regions after mating and trying unsuccessfully to find additional partners.</li>
                        <li><span> INTERNESTING HABITATS</span> - During the nesting season, which can last one to two months, females remain close to their nesting beach. Female turtles produce between two and seven clutches (a group of eggs laid during one egg-laying event) per season, or one clutch every ten to fifteen days, depending on the species. The only exceptions to this pattern are Olive ridley and Kemp's ridley turtles, which lay their eggs during arribadas, or synchronized mass nesting occasions, which take place once a month and last for three to seven days.</li>
