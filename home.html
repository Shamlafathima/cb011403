            <p>
                We all know that the beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka is world-famous for its plethora of wildlife. Along with our leopards, sloth bears and elephants, we are lucky to have an extremely rich biodiversity in our tropical sea as well. Different species of sea  turtles grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. While these highly migratory species periodically come ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of their lives in the ocean. 
            </p>
            <p >
                In Sri Lanka, there are lots of turtle hatcheries. For turtles, it is a very beneficial and secure strategy. Theoretically, it's similar to a fairytale with a happy conclusion. Unaware sea turtle moms deposit their eggs on the southern beaches of Sri Lanka, but suddenly, poachers steal their young to make turtle egg omelettes! By buying the eggs from poachers, turtle hatcheries fortunately rush in and save the eggs. When the eggs are ready to hatch, they are carefully tucked away in their safe nursery, far from predators and poachers like feral dogs and water monitors. The hatchlings are finally released into the ocean at dusk.

                    Sea turtles are essential to a healthy ocean. Sea turtles are considered "keystone species," which implies they have a significant impact on the surrounding ecosystem and other species. The natural order can be upset if a keystone species is eliminated from an area, which has various effects on other animals and plant life.

                <li> <span> Ecological Balance:</span> Sea turtles play a vital role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems. They help control populations of jellyfish, seagrass, and other prey species, which helps maintain the balance of the food web.</li>
                <li> <span>Tourism and Recreation:</span>  Sea turtles attract tourists and nature enthusiasts to coastal areas, contributing to local economies through activities such as turtle watching tours, snorkeling, and diving.</li>
                <li> <span>Fisheries Support:</span>  Sea turtles help sustain fisheries by maintaining healthy coral reefs and seagrass beds, which serve as vital habitats for commercially important fish species. Healthy fisheries provide food and livelihoods for coastal communities.</li>
                <li> <span>Environmental Education:</span>  Sea turtles serve as flagship species for conservation efforts, raising awareness about marine ecosystems and the need for their protection. Their conservation efforts often lead to broader conservation initiatives benefiting other species and habitats.</li>
                <li> <span>Research and Scientific Advancement:</span>  Studying sea turtles provides insights into marine ecology, migratory patterns, and the impacts of environmental changes. This knowledge aids in the development of conservation strategies and policies.

         <div id="list_3">
            <ul> 
                <li> <span>Conservation Efforts:</span>  Many individuals and organizations work to protect sea turtles by conserving nesting beaches, implementing fishing regulations, and raising awareness about their importance. These efforts have helped increase sea turtle populations in some regions</li>
                <li> <span>Threats from Human Activities:</span>  Human activities such as pollution, habitat destruction, accidental capture in fishing gear (bycatch), and poaching pose significant threats to sea turtles. These actions can result in injury or death, hinder their nesting habits, and disrupt their marine environment.</li>
                <li> <span>Tourism and Education:</span>  Sea turtles are popular attractions for ecotourism, with guided tours and snorkeling or diving opportunities. Responsible ecotourism can raise awareness about sea turtle conservation, while improper practices, such as touching or disturbing the animals, can cause stress or harm.</li>
                <li> <span>Plastic Pollution:</span>  Sea turtles are particularly vulnerable to plastic pollution as they can mistake plastic bags and other debris for food. Ingesting or becoming entangled in plastic can lead to serious injuries or death.</li>
                <li> <span>Research and Study:</span>  Scientists and researchers study sea turtles to better understand their biology, migration patterns, and conservation needs. This knowledge helps inform conservation strategies and improve our understanding of these ancient marine creatures.</li>

            <p>
                Overall, the relationship between sea turtles and humans can be positive when conservation efforts are prioritized, and negative when human activities threaten their survival. It is crucial to promote responsible behavior, reduce pollution, and protect their habitats to ensure the long-term well-being of sea turtles.
